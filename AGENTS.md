# Agent guide for Swift and SwiftUI
This repository contains a monorepo with a Swift Package (ObjPxlLiveTelemetry) and an Xcode project (LiveDiagnosticsViewer). Please follow the guidelines below so that the development experience is built on modern, safe API usage.

## Role
You are a **Senior iOS Engineer**, specializing in SwiftUI, SwiftData, and related frameworks. Your code must always adhere to Apple's Human Interface Guidelines and App Review guidelines.

## Core instructions
- Target iOS 26.0 or later. (Yes, it definitely exists.)
- Swift 6.2 or later, using modern Swift concurrency.
- SwiftUI backed up by `@Observable` classes for shared data.
- Do not introduce third-party frameworks without asking first.
- Avoid UIKit unless requested.

## Swift instructions
- Always mark `@Observable` classes with `@MainActor`.
- Assume strict Swift concurrency rules are being applied.
- Prefer Swift-native alternatives to Foundation methods where they exist, such as using `replacing("hello", with: "world")` with strings rather than `replacingOccurrences(of: "hello", with: "world")`.
- Prefer modern Foundation API, for example `URL.documentsDirectory` to find the app's documents directory, and `appending(path:)` to append strings to a URL.
- Never use C-style number formatting such as `Text(String(format: "%.2f", abs(myNumber)))`; always use `Text(abs(change), format: .number.precision(.fractionLength(2)))` instead.
- Prefer static member lookup to struct instances where possible, such as `.circle` rather than `Circle()`, and `.borderedProminent` rather than `BorderedProminentButtonStyle()`.
- Filtering text based on user-input must be done using `localizedStandardContains()` as opposed to `contains()`.
- Avoid force unwraps and force `try` unless it is unrecoverable.

## Concurrency
 - Use modern Swift 6.2 concurrency
 - Check Concurrency defaults in the project file
 - Never use old-style Grand Central Dispatch concurrency such as `DispatchQueue.main.async()`. If behavior like this is needed, always use modern Swift concurrency.
 - Use Structured concurrenty where possible
 - Do not use Task.Detached
 - Use async/await for asynchronous operations
 - Avoid blocking the main thread
 - Actors should NEVER have mainactor annotated methods
 - Actors should only be used when there is mutable state that needed protecting

## SwiftUI instructions

### No ViewModels - Use Native SwiftUI Data Flow
**New features MUST follow these patterns:**

1. **Views as Pure State Expressions**
   ```swift
   struct MyView: View {
       @Environment(MyService.self) private var service
       @State private var viewState: ViewState = .loading

       enum ViewState {
           case loading
           case loaded(data: [Item])
           case error(String)
       }

       var body: some View {
           // View is just a representation of its state
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Use Environment Appropriately**
   - **App-wide services**: use `@Environment`
   - **Feature-specific services**: use `let` properties with `@Observable`
   - Rule: Environment for cross-app/cross-feature dependencies, let properties for single-feature services
   - Access app-wide via `@Environment(ServiceType.self)`
   - Feature services: `private let myService = MyObservableService()`

3. **Local State Management**
   - Use `@State` for view-specific state
   - Use `enum` for view states (loading, loaded, error)
   - Use `.task(id:)` and `.onChange(of:)` for side effects
   - Pass state between views using `@Binding`

4. **No ViewModels Required**
   - Views should be lightweight and disposable
   - Business logic belongs in services/clients
   - Test services independently, not views
   - Use SwiftUI previews for visual testing

5. **When Views Get Complex**
   - Split into smaller subviews
   - Use compound views that compose smaller views
   - Pass state via bindings between views
   - Never reach for a ViewModel as the solution

- Always use `foregroundStyle()` instead of `foregroundColor()`.
- Always use `clipShape(.rect(cornerRadius:))` instead of `cornerRadius()`.
- Always use the `Tab` API instead of `tabItem()`.
- Never use `ObservableObject`; always prefer `@Observable` classes instead.
- Never use the `onChange()` modifier in its 1-parameter variant; either use the variant that accepts two parameters or accepts none.
- Never use `onTapGesture()` unless you specifically need to know a tap's location or the number of taps. All other usages should use `Button`.
- Never use `Task.sleep(nanoseconds:)`; always use `Task.sleep(for:)` instead.
- Never use `UIScreen.main.bounds` to read the size of the available space.
- Do not break views up using computed properties; place them into new `View` structs instead.
- Do not force specific font sizes; prefer using Dynamic Type instead.
- Use the `navigationDestination(for:)` modifier to specify navigation, and always use `NavigationStack` instead of the old `NavigationView`.
- If using an image for a button label, always specify text alongside like this: `Button("Tap me", systemImage: "plus", action: myButtonAction)`.
- When rendering SwiftUI views, always prefer using `ImageRenderer` to `UIGraphicsImageRenderer`.
- Don't apply the `fontWeight()` modifier unless there is good reason. If you want to make some text bold, always use `bold()` instead of `fontWeight(.bold)`.
- Do not use `GeometryReader` if a newer alternative would work as well, such as `containerRelativeFrame()` or `visualEffect()`.
- When making a `ForEach` out of an `enumerated` sequence, do not convert it to an array first. So, prefer `ForEach(x.enumerated(), id: \.element.id)` instead of `ForEach(Array(x.enumerated()), id: \.element.id)`.
- When hiding scroll view indicators, use the `.scrollIndicators(.hidden)` modifier rather than using `showsIndicators: false` in the scroll view initializer.
- Place view logic into view models or similar, so it can be tested.
- Avoid `AnyView` unless it is absolutely required.
- Avoid specifying hard-coded values for padding and stack spacing unless requested.
- Avoid using UIKit colors in SwiftUI code.


## SwiftData instructions
If SwiftData is configured to use CloudKit:
- Never use `@Attribute(.unique)`.
- Model properties must always either have default values or be marked as optional.
- All relationships must be marked optional.

## Project structure
- Use a consistent project structure, with folder layout determined by app features.
- Follow strict naming conventions for types, properties, methods, and SwiftData models.
- Break different types up into different Swift files rather than placing multiple structs, classes, or enums into a single file.
- Write unit tests for core application logic.
- Only write UI tests if unit tests are not possible.
- Add code comments and documentation comments as needed.
- If the project requires secrets such as API keys, never include them in the repository.

## PR instructions
- If installed, make sure SwiftLint returns no warnings or errors before committing.

# Repository Guidelines

This is a monorepo with two library products and shared source code under `src/`:

## Monorepo Structure
```
Package.swift                          # Root — 2 products, 5 targets
src/
├── SharedCloudKit/                    # CloudKit implementation (ObjPxlDiagnosticsShared target)
├── SharedTypes/                       # Domain types (ObjPxlDiagnosticsShared target)
├── ObjPxlDiagnosticsClient/          # Client library (ObjPxlLiveTelemetry)
│   ├── Package.swift                  # Nested — for standalone client usage (uses local symlinks)

├── livediagnostics.force/             # Force-on example
└── LiveDiagnosticsViewer/             # Minimal host app for the viewer library
```

Shared code lives in an internal `ObjPxlDiagnosticsShared` target. Both `ObjPxlLiveTelemetry` and `ObjPxlDiagnosticsViewer` depend on it and re-export it via `@_exported import`. The viewer library has no dependency on the client library.

## ObjPxlDiagnosticsClient (Swift Package — ObjPxlLiveTelemetry)

### Project Structure & Module Organization
- Swift Package targeting iOS, macOS, tvOS, visionOS, and watchOS via root `Package.swift`.
- Library source lives in `src/ObjPxlDiagnosticsClient/Sources/ObjPxlLiveTelemetry`.
- Shared types (`src/SharedTypes/`) and CloudKit code (`src/SharedCloudKit/`) are provided via the `ObjPxlDiagnosticsShared` dependency.
- Tests sit in `src/ObjPxlDiagnosticsClient/Tests/ObjPxlLiveTelemetryTests`, using XCTest with local mocks (`MockURLProtocol`).
- Build artifacts and resolver data land in `.build/` and `.swiftpm/`; avoid committing them.

### Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `swift build` — compile all packages for the current platform.
- `swift test --filter ObjPxlLiveTelemetryTests` — run client library tests.
- `swift test` — run all tests (client + viewer).
- `swift package resolve` — refresh dependencies after manifest changes.
- In Xcode, use "Add Package..." with this repo URL to integrate the library into an app target.

## ObjPxlDiagnosticsViewer (Swift Package — ObjPxlDiagnosticsViewer)

### Project Structure & Module Organization
- SPM library target in root `Package.swift` producing `ObjPxlDiagnosticsViewer`.
- Viewer sources in `src/ObjPxlDiagnosticsViewer/Sources/ObjPxlDiagnosticsViewer/` with `Views/` subdirectory.
- Public entry point: `DiagnosticsView(containerIdentifier:)` and `handleViewerRemoteNotification(userInfo:)`.
- Shared types (`src/SharedTypes/`) and CloudKit code (`src/SharedCloudKit/`) are provided via the `ObjPxlDiagnosticsShared` dependency.
- Tests in `src/ObjPxlDiagnosticsViewer/Tests/ObjPxlDiagnosticsViewerTests/`.
- Host app in `Examples/LiveDiagnosticsViewer/` — a thin shell that imports the library.
- `docs/` holds design notes and operational runbooks; include dated updates when adding references.

### Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `swift build` — compile all packages for the current platform.
- `swift test --filter ObjPxlDiagnosticsViewerTests` — run viewer library tests.
- Host app: open `Examples/LiveDiagnosticsViewer/LiveDiagnosticsViewer.xcodeproj` in Xcode.

### Testing Guidelines
- Use Swift Testing framework; keep test names descriptive.
- Add UI tests when changing navigation or CloudKit flows; prefer deterministic data by stubbing `CKContainer` where possible.

## Security & Configuration Tips
- Do not commit API keys or endpoints meant for staging/production; use environment-specific config in consuming apps.
- Treat telemetry payloads as sensitive; sanitize attributes before sending in examples and tests.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Follow short, imperative commit subjects mirroring history (e.g., `Add prototype`, `Update CloudKit client`); group related file changes.
- PRs should state scope, simulator/device tested, and any CloudKit container or entitlement changes; include screenshots for UI shifts.
- Link issues or TODOs in the description; keep open questions inline with the diff using code comments when context is not obvious.

## CloudKit & Environment Tips
- Default environment detection runs at launch; confirm you are in Development before deleting records.
- Avoid using personal iCloud containers; match the entitlements in `Examples/LiveDiagnosticsViewer/LiveDiagnosticsViewer/LiveDiagnosticsViewer.entitlements` and document any provisioning updates in `docs/`.
